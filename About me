    <h2>Programming:</h2>
    <p>I had my first contact with technology when I was very young, I spent a lot of time on the computer and I really liked games (Friv was my favorite website). When I was in high school I enrolled in a technical computer course, where I had my first contact with programming and I hated it. </p>
  <p>  After that I joined another technical course, this time in logistics, and although I really liked the course, I didn't get any opportunities in the area, so I ended up going back to programming and started my degree in Internet Systems.</p>
  <p>The language I was most familiar with was Java (as incredible as it may seem), I also know HTML, CSS and a little JS and PHP.
I'm very curious about the Ruby language, and I would like to learn it one day.</p>

    <h2>English:</h2>
    <p>Since I was very young, I have always been curious about learning new things, and English was one of the first that, in addition to being curious, I had the discipline to learn it on my own. I managed to learn the language without taking classes, courses or anything like that. Because I started learning I'm very young and I don't have an accent or accent when speaking the language.</p>
  <p>  The main reason I was curious and started learning was because I was curious to understand some songs by my favorite singer: Justin Bieber, although it was a silly reason, it was what encouraged me a lot at the time. Nowadays I'm still very I'm a fan of his, but I haven't had the chance to go to any shows yet :(</p>
  <p> I watched a lot of documentaries about marine life, macabre stories and interviews with famous singers, which helped me a lot with my pronunciation. And as I always liked reading, I managed to combine the useful with the pleasant. I practiced English by reading books, comics, Webtoons and fanfics in the language..</p>

    <h2>Others...</h2>
    <p>I've worked for over two years in customer service, as a receptionist, and I simply hated every second of it. At first, I was very shy and had difficulty adapting, but as time went by I became more communicative (out of necessity), but despite this making my work and relationships with my colleagues much easier, I still couldn't wait. to leave there, despite being extremely grateful for the opportunity</p>
    <p>I was also an intern in the commercial sector, but due to having to balance work, internship and college, I ended up leaving the company, as I was unable to cope.</p>
